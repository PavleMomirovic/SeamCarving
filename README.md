Not yet finished.
For now what it can do is make a GrayScale photo based on one that you called a program for via CMD.
Should be called with: -in test.png -out grayScaleTest.png
Picture should be .png

**Gray Scale is showing the importance of each pixel when it comes to compressing
(whiter the pixel the more important it is, and the chances that it will get lost in compression are lower)
